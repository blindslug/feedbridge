# Run with Docker

There's an official Feedbridge image located on https://hub.docker.com/r/tehwey/feedbridge/. To
run the latest version just make use of the included `docker-compose` file.

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

After that it'll run on Port 8080 and listening on localhost.
